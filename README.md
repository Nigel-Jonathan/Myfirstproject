# MyFirstProject
This is a Java project I submitted in my 9th grade. It is a simple player Vs Computer cricket(Hand-cricket) game.
It uses the random funtion to select a random number from 1 to 10. It is then compared to the player's number to decide if it runs or out. The player with highest score wins.
